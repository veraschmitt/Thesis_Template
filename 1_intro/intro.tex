The introduction is structured in three different parts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first part is a teaser for the topic of the thesis and should be framed such, that the reader is promptly interested in the topic (1. paragraph)
    \item The second section should be what the focus of the thesis is about and should give also some hints why this is crucial (2. paragraph).
    \item The third section gives an outlook for the structure of the thesis. The second section will give an overview of the relevant state-of-the-art literature. The third section will.... and so forth (3. paragraph).
\end{enumerate}

The introduction can be 1-2 pages long. 
Sometimes, when the structure of the thesis is complicated you can add a graph to visualize the structure to make it more comprehensible.
